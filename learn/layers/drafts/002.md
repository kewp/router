# layers

let's build things up one layer at a time.

## packets

say `alice` wants to send a packet (package)
to `bob`.

```js
alice.send(bob, packet);
```

what might the packet be?
and how might bob reply?

clearly bob needs to decide
what to do with the packet.
perhaps one thing, perhaps
many, perhaps none.

let's start by defining a
`router` and some `actions` -
the router looks at the packet
and decides which actions to take.
again, perhaps one, perhaps many,
perhaps none.

```js
let actions = {
    'log': {
        conditions: {},
        fn: packet => console.log('got packet',packet)
    }
}

let runner = (packet, action) => {
    action.fn(packet);
}

let router = packet => {
    Object.keys(actions).forEach(name => {
        action = actions[name];
        if (match_conditions)
            runner(packet, action);
    })
}
```
