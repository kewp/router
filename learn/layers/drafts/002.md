# layers

let's build things up one layer at a time.

## packets

say `alice` wants to send a packet (package)
to `bob`.

```js
alice.send(bob, packet);
```

what might the packet be?
and how might bob reply?

clearly bob needs to decide
what to do with the packet.
perhaps one thing, perhaps
many, perhaps none.

let's start by defining a
`router` and some `actions` -
the router looks at the packet
and decides which actions to take.
again, perhaps one, perhaps many,
perhaps none.

```js
let actions = {
    'log': {
        conditions: {},
        fn: packet => console.log('got packet',packet)
    }
}

let runner = (packet, action) => {
    action.fn(packet);
}

let router = packet => {
    Object.keys(actions).forEach(name => {
        action = actions[name];
        if (match_conditions)
            runner(packet, action);
    })
}
```

why send a packet? why, jim?

well i can think of two reasons - either
alice wants to let bob know something
(like "hey something just happened"),
or alice wants something from bob, like
"hey what was that guys name again".

of course, bob could do anything with
the packet. he could scan the whole
internet. or print something using
an old printer, like dot-matrix...

so we need to get bob to send a packet
back, in case alice needs something in
response. and for that we need to
be able to identify whether a packet
is connected to a previously sent
packet...

so clearly the packet needs to have
some identifier that the sender
put into it. then when a packet
comes in it checks if that id is
present, somehow ...

what else? have we covered everything
that might happen or that we might need
to consider given what we have discussed
so far / the scenario we have drawn out ... ?

well when it comes to responses ... we
may need to consider time. so you could
say "hey i am waiting for this response
and it's been like forever" ...

what else?

well clearly a packet received can cause
another packet to be sent. so if alice
can send a packet to bob then bob should
be able to send a packet to alice.

also _actions_ should have in them an
ability to send packets. and not necessarily
just back ...

also, what about sending a packet to
yourself? in essense this means we could ...
call our own actions ...

and what about state? i mean, one thing
that could occur is a packet changes bob
in some way, makes him more open to
new experiences, less argumentative,
more interested in gardening ... bob is
different now. we can model that generically.

```js
let bob = {
    state: {
        happiness: 4,
        openness: 2,
        likes_gardening: 10
    },
    actions: {
        increase_happiness: state => state.set('happiness',state.get('happiness') + 1)
    }
}
```

i write out the state change in terms of functions
to make a point - if we don't allow direct access
to the state object but instead use function calls
(something we can actually force using proxies in
javascript but that's besides the point here) we
get a lot of benefits, like being able to put guards
in place for bad values, as well as tracing changes
(useful for debugging, and let's you do magic things
like reactive programming where things update on
their own in response to changes).

ok. so alice and bob both have a state. they have
actions. actions can change the state. actions can
send packets. actions occur in response to packets.

why? why are we doing this? how could you do something
like that, karl?!

it's hard to explain because i didn't come upon this
by some great insight but rather trial and error - 
when writing software you want certain things to happen.
you want to be able to understand what you are doing,
you want to be able to trace the effects, you want
to be able to place guards in, to simplify the solution
space ...

and what we've done here, i surmise, is build some
way to generically encapsulate, well, a module...

again i didn't design this out of some kind of
mathematical understanding. rather it's where i
ended up when i kept insisting that all my wants
as a developer be met with the systems i was working
on - being able to have full view of what was
happening. being able to isolate parts. being
able to have things work seemlessly across
boundaries i.e. not having a dozen different
systems i have to keep in my head at the same
time to understand what was happening ...
context switching.

think about it - if bob and alice are both
generic compute units, and the way they
communicate is generic, by which i mean
you could use http, or web sockets, or
in memory - then surely you could design
the entire software ecosystem using these
building blocks: some on a server somewhere,
some more on other servers, yet more on
clients like the browser and others the
mobile phone ... all built using the
same approach, the same set of building
blocks ... just imagine that, the entire
system, all the different moving parts,
using the same set of blocks - some in
python, sure, some in javascript,
whatever language you like, but each
with actions (or handlers?), each with
a state, each with every state change
traceable, each action initiated by
a packet, each packet following the
same conventions, each letting you
respond to packets and logging them
out, everything traceable, everything
serialisable, visualisable, all without
restricting functionality, all with
every piece naturally asynchronous,
all naturally parallel, all naturally
expandable ... imagine having a web
server that showed you graphically
of your whole system, let you click
on any part of it, let you watch
packets flying around ... not just
between servers and between processes
in servers, but between parts of the
processes! you could just keep clicking,
keep zooming in, to see everything,
literally everything, at whatever
scale you wanted - you could record
a second's worth of activity and
go through every part of your software
step by step ... you would have one,
just one, approach needed to debug
every aspect ... every aspect could
be hot-swapped out, a/b tested ...
solving any problem, testing any
feature, deploying, fuzzing, everything
with the same approach. why? because
it's just communication. the heart
of computing is sending something.
doing something with it. sending
something else. maybe this is the analogy
we need. maybe this, and the subsequent
things we can say like actions, like
replies, like timeouts, like a local
state ... maybe those are really
generic enough to be universal.
maybe ... i dunno, let's build it
and see.
